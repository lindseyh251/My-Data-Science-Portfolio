# 📚 My Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I'm Lindsey! I recently graduated with a Master's degree in applied statistics and data science at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). I also have a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Creighton University. Currently, I work as a graduate assistant at the Institute for Policy and Social Research (IPSR) at KU, and I previously worked as a data modernization intern for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE). 

This repository showcases the advanced projects and analyses I have completed during my courses and demonstrates my knowledge of statistical modeling, programming, and data science. 

## My Programming Languages ##
- R  — (Shiny for interactive applications), data visualization, statistical modeling
- Python — Jupyter notebooks, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas (for machine learning, data manipulation, and deep learning)
- Tableau — interactive business intelligence, data visualization, and reporting

This project was completed in R for my Linear Regression course (STAT 840) and investigates the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across different countries between 2000 and 2015 while controlling for other potential sources of variation. 

[Predicting Prostate Specific Antigen Levels from Prognostic Clinical Measurements in Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer](https://github.com/lindseyh251/KUMedPortfolio/blob/6d5e55c1d7833f733cd57e92bb387bbbadc148de/Predicting%20PSA%20Levels%20from%20Prognostic%20Clinical%20Measurements%20in%20Men%20with%20Advanced%20Prostate%20Cancer%20(R%20code))

[PowerPointSlidesforPSA.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18526051/PSAFinal.pptx)


This project was completed in R for my Introduction to Programming and Applied Statistics course (STAT 823) and performs statistical linear modeling to determine if there is an association between prostate-specific antigen (PSA level) and prognostic clinical measurements in men with advanced prostate cancer. 

[Predicting a Death Event from Ejection Fraction Values in Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases](https://github.com/lindseyh251/KUMedPortfolio/blob/94005eaa2b95a1fa0a9432c676e9baf80ac6b742/Predicting%20a%20Death%20Event%20from%20Ejection%20Fraction%20Values%20in%20Patients%20with%20Cardiovascular%20Disease%20(R%20code))

[(R Markdown zip)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18525574/MyFinal.Rmd.zip)

This project was completed in R for my Categorical Data Analysis course (STAT 835) and investigates the relationship between a “death event” (0,1) and ejection fraction for patients at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan) during April–December 2015 while controlling for other potential sources of variation.

[Predicting Presence at March Madness Tournament 2024](https://github.com/lindseyh251/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/84192183ebe2db30f0bdb03f61f3e8437c26a7a0/my_projects/march_madness_projects/march_madness_2024.R)

[Profiling Royals Hitters using Classification and Principal Components (2024 season)](https://github.com/lindseyh251/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/9c80ab2940fe699ebb6a92f7d3bfcf3dcc4f10d3/my_projects/royals_hitters)

## Python Projects ##
[Final CNN Project](https://github.com/lindseyh251/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/my_projects/cnn_project/FinalCNN.py)

This project was for my STAT 882 course in which I built a convolutional neural network to classify images from a data repository containing 5,000 small images (32x32) of 2 groups (horses and deer). For my project, I split the data 80% training and 20% validataion with the goal of getting an accuracy > 0.80. I used Jupyter notebook and used the python packages Keras, Tensorflow, and Matplotlib. 

[Archery Scorer Project](https://github.com/lindseyh251/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/my_projects/archery_scorer_project/archery_scorer.py)

This archery scoring game was completed during an undergraduate python course competition.


## Data Visualization Projects (Tableau and RShiny) ##

[Screenshot of dashboard](https://github.com/lindseyh251/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/my_projects/insurance_project/InsuranceDashboard.png)

This project was completed during my data modernization internship and is an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes the change in insurance charges of patients based on age, BMI, sex, US Region, number of dependents, and smoker status. 


[KS_Population_RShiny_App](https://github.com/lindseyh251/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/my_projects/ks_population_project/KS_Population_RShiny_App.R)    

This project was completed for my DATA 824 course and is an interactive R Shiny dashboard that analyzes the population and population change of different Kansas counties from 2010 - 2018.
